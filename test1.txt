Project Overview
Tracing the evolution and impact of Alexander Melville Bell’s "Visible Speech," a system of “universal shorthand,” in relation to Pitmanic and other systems of shorthand, to emerging communications technologies, particularly Alexander Graham Bell’s research related to the telephone, and to the foundation of the first college composition program in the United States at Harvard College in the 1870s, this project is one section of a research project in writing and media studies dedicated to investigating relationships and dynamics amongst conceptions of verbal language, nineteenth century systems of shorthand, and the early history of college writing programs in the United States. Utilizing the manuscript and print resources in the Beale Shorthand Collection (1640 – 1910) and the Jerome B. Howard Shorthand Collection (1710-1912) at the New York Public Library’s Stephen A. Schwarzman Building will greatly enhance the progress and quality of the project by enabling the analysis as physical artifacts of several important documents and publications in the history of shorthand from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries.



















Project Background

The various elements of HMB’s shorthand system are themselves remediated in its traces and afterlives in writing instruction pedagogy, stage and film adaptations, and specific tools and applications for digital computing systems.

In the earliest printed systems of shorthand, we see the elements and ambitions of today’s machine languages.  A universal character (words and things), a world language that everyone can speak and read and that in its very design eliminates any ambiguity of signification and communication.  

What was a system of ciphers becomes one about standardization and later about speed and accuracy. It shows how technologies evolve. An instrument used across time in different climates of representation shows how definitions and functions of verbal language are in relation to available media.

While it is fairly uncommon to think about something as ancient as the alphabet as a technology, it is one. Nonetheless, as media critic Neil Postman points out, when he would ask his students “when the alphabet was invented,” the question “astonished” them.  It was, he writes, “as if I asked them when clouds and trees were invented.”  Though the many technologies involved with literacy—the alphabet, pencils, pens, books, printing presses—may be so familiar to us as to seem almost “natural,” they were all at one time new technologies that have had—and continue to have--numerous and profound affects on reading and writing practices.  As the historian Ruth Schwartz Cohen explains, “even languages and the things that contain languages (such as books, letters, computer software, and student essays) are technologies:  they are things that people have created so as to better control and manipulate the social environment.”    

The potential impact of information and communications technology (ICT)  on literacy practices and the cognitive processes associated with them is one that, for many different reasons, has attracted a lot of attention in the media and is one that some critics believe may be cause for great concern.  If we think about the line separating humans and machines (see also Chapter 2), literacy is something that makes us not only peculiarly human, but is one of the great institutions though which culture is transmitted, recorded, and founded.  But ICT is changing literacy practices and the many offshoots of this:  publishing, education and scholarship.  Many have compared the changes happening now in our digital age with those that took place in the 15th century and the advent of the printing press.  The scale of these changes will be large and their effects profound.  While it may be too early to really know what these changes may be, there is in the meantime a great deal to write and think about with regard to literacy practices and how various technologies—both old and new—are related to these practices.

As one of the oldest information and communications technologies still in active use, the Roman alphabet could easily win the award for best invention ever.  

As far as technical standards go, the Roman alphabet has had a very long run in the West.  Though challenged over the years by hundreds of alternate alphabets designed to improve our ability to materialize and communicate meaning in verbal language,  improve communication and signification, the Roman alphabet, having been embedded in commercial, bureaucratic, educational and publishing systems since the 15th c., is only now being seriously questioned as the standard interface to literacy.  And, as our ability to readily communicate with signs other than alphabetic representations of verbal language, i.e., still and moving digital images, emojis, voice to text inscription tools, increases, the many different things connoted and denoted by this term literacy only takes on further meanings. Further, as technologies enabling our ability to communicate and create meaning in non-alphabetic multimedial sign systems proliferate, it is, from a common-sense point of view not surprising, though at the same time of great import to note the ways in which the very definitions of this term literacy are likewise expanding.  Connoting not just the ability to recognize and inscribe alphabetic letters but, more recently, the achievement of a certain level of competency in tasks related to playing video games, making sense of visual images, and even preparing food, the term literacy appears to be one that is in the process of being redefined by educators, scholars, and the public (Gee; Shaffer; Kress; Daley; Culinary Literacy Center).  However, the dynamics involved in what is actually going in this redefinition of literacy and how much alphabetic literacy remains very much in process.  Questions such as how much multimedial communication is a remediation of alphabetic literacy as opposed to a new mode of communication and what it means for humans to no longer be alphabetically literate to communicate via written sign systems are just a few that need to be addressed.

the need to articulate exactly what is going on with literacy practices and how today’s multimodal and highly automated acts of communication relate to the current practices and histories of language and writing instruction make it important to flesh out what has not been fleshed out in writing studies.  Systems of shorthand, which are one of the oldest technologies of inscription for recording, reproducing, and storing verbal language offer a repository for better understanding the instrumental elements of verbal language and its adaptations in digital environments. Verbal=spoken, alphabetic, instrumental

Despite the explicitly stated importance of communication to the fields of cybernetics and infromation processing (Wiener), the field of media and writing studies continues to play catch up in its ability to adequately theorize and describe the roles and functions inscribed verbal communication.  As the linguist Roy Harris pointed out in his book “Rethinking Writing,” although, in the field of mathematics, there has long been a distinction made between a notation, i.e., a figure, and a script, “there is no such simple and perspicuous statement available in the cases of language” (94).  



Remediating is a project dedicated to defining and investigating the discrete elements of writing and to thinking about how the media we use in the creation, production, and distribution of writing relate to how writing happens and what writing may mean.  Functioning at once as a graphical, logical, and poetic sign system, verbal language, which is transmitted by writing in different media, has unique properties depending on the medium or media employed for its dissemination (Drucker).
As one of the oldest information and communications technologies in the West, systems of shorthand, which have been in use since the Classical period, offer a unique lens through which to analyze the roles and functions of verbal language in relation to the social and material technologies shaping their definitions (characteristics), applications, and affordances.  

I'm writing about systems of shorthand alphabets--one of the oldest information and communications technologies--to illustrate its impact on the history of composition programs, which is significant because some unique aspects of Bell's system continue to inform writing instruction and writing machines into the 20th c. such as writing instruction as a set of instructions, written communication as being separated from spoken communication, conceiving of the human body as an instrument in general and a writing instrument in particular, the afterlives of HMB's system in media, popular culture, and the public imagination. Visible Speech and shorthand in general is important to understanding the histories and presents of the college composition course in the U.S.  While there has been a lot written about the foundation of the Harvard Composition program, I am focusing on its pre-history in the 1860s and, specifically, showing how via Melville Bell's work, writing became an applied science at Harvard. In terms of the history of communications technologies and digital computers, this early definition of writing as an applied science is very interesting, especially in conjunction with the understanding that, shorthand itself grows out of an urge to standardize verbal language. The history of shorthand in the 17th c. can, I believe tell us something about the tensions that still exist.  the history of shorthand can be studied both diachronically, i.e., in specific periods, and synchronically, i.e., across time, to reveal things about the functional aspects of verbal language and its relationships to a wide range of print and digital information and communication technologies.  
 

Shorthand has a long history in the West, and according to some of its many nineteenth century chroniclers, proponents and historians (most of whom usually wore all three hats at one time), its evolution can be seen as reflection of the progressive and ever evolving history of writing from its very origins to the present (Pitman, Gitelman).  From a twenty first century perspective, this very notion that shorthand could have some indexical relationship to the history of writing in its entirety is just one of the many intriguing threads that need to be investigated in relation to the history of shorthand systems. Having received comparatively little attention in relation to the history of composition programs in the U.S., systems of shorthand have, however, been the subject of increasing interest to literary scholars and media historians.  In her 2009 book, “Shakespeare in Shorthand: The Textual Mystery of King Lear,” Adele Davidson reconsiders the importance of John Willis’ system of shorthand to the recording and eventual printing of early editions of “King Lear” and in his 2017 article, “Stenography and Orality in Dickens,”    of one of the many intriguing things about systems of shorthand and their representations and promotions in the nineteenth century is The positing and active creation of such a grand historical narrative about the “progress” of language, human history, and technologies as encapsulated in the “history” of shorthand published primarily by Pitman’s press reveal more about the ambitions of Pitmanic shorthand itself as they do documentary history, though undoubtedly the latter is one trace.  Reading these 19th c. histories of shorthand against the artifcactual and documentary history of shorthand, it becomes possible to reveal the many social and material technologies at work in the 19th c. I continue to think that analyzing the roles and affordances of specific print technologies in the formation of different systems of “universal writing,” many of which are in the 19th c., retrospectively categorized as shorthand is useful  For, universal language systems and shorthand as one subset of it are both places where the “functional” aspects of writing as communicative media are to some extent isolated from the other functions of writing and, as a result, it is possible to study them both diachronically and synchronically to better understand the roles and interactions and influences of different social and material technologies of language and communication through their particular uses and applications, as well as their aspirations, at any given moment in time (cf: depictions and representations of shorthand in Classical times in the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries).  

The narratives constructed in the 19th c. about shorthand are themselves important inventions, particularly since they coincide almost exactly with the development of public literacy initiatives.  Shorthand and its histories can tell us some things about the histories of capitalism and the roles and functions scientific discourse (real and constructed) and the book in those histories.  HMB’s system of shorthand emerges quite late in this history, in the 1860s and, importantly, grows out of the business of shorthand established by Isaac and Benn Pitman in the 1840s.  [Self improvement, public literacy education, vocational training, and commercial publishing become intertwined in the mid-19th c.]  

While no documentary evidence of Tironian Shorthand, the system created by Cicero’s slave and secretary Tiro in the 1st c. B.C. survive, we do have copies of this system or one based on it in medieval manuscripts.  Textual evidence points to the unsurprising fact that Tironian shorthand is itself not new, being based on a Greek system that dates to the time of Socrates.    

The history of shorthand shows that overtime, what was a storage, organization, and encoding "technology" becomes one that is about standardization and efficient production.  Dividing the history of shorthand into three major periods: 1/ Classical; 2/ Manuscript; 3/ Print and each of those into more discrete segments, it is possible to trace the changes in shorthand over time to the development of specific technologies of reproduction and distribution in each period and the socio-cultural and economic systems associated with them, i.e., education, educational publishing, commercial book market.  While my focus is on the later part of the Print period, the long history of shorthand (and those writing systems that are retrospectively labeled as such) and its use in pre-Print communications systems offers fertile ground for further research into relationships amongst print based and manuscript cultures [movable type is invented in the 11th c. even if it is not in wide spread use in Europe until the 15th c.].  

In the 16th and 17th centuries shorthand is strongly connected to lexicography and the organization of knowledge (Bright and Wilkins).  By the 18th c., shorthand is already being explored in commercial terms.  This continues into the 19th c., when government sponsored educational and communications initiatives in the UK (first the penny post, later in the century, the English Free School legislation) combined with new printing technologies (lithography, rotary and steam printing presses) result in the reforming of shorthand as one that is then about vocational education and self-improvement/betterment.  Once HMB gets involved with shorthand, Pitman has already established a booming business.  

It is from Lisa Gitelman’s investigations into shorthand as one of several technologies of inscription that reflect and shape the “climate of representation” in the 19th c. U.S. where my interest in shorthand began.  Her analysis of shorthand and its relations to Edison’s development of the phonograph in her 1990 book “Scripts, Grooves, and Writing Machines: Representing Technology in the Edison Era” is a guiding one for my own research.  Gitelman’s theoretical discussion of “the climate of representation within which nineteenth-century shorthand developed and prospered” (62) is both elegant and authoritative.  I can add little but I can offer a slightly different disciplinary perspective that, because it is related to textual studies and the history of print, broadens the scope of her analysis, which is dedicated almost exclusively to Pitmanic shorthand.

However, I approach the subject more from the perspective of writing and textual studies and the history of print, as opposed to hers, which focuses more on the social histories of technologies of inscription in what she calls “the climate of representation in the 19th c.”  [I continue to think that her use of this phrase “climate of representation” is a very useful one, particularly in a 21st c. context.]

Shorthand in the 19th c. and HMB’s Visible Speech

1.  The history of what comes to be called shorthand in the 19th c. is long and very tightly intertwined with various technologies of reproduction, communication and distribution, i.e., letter press printing, sound recording, engraving, lithography, photography, the penny post, the telephone, and the phonograph.
2.  Further, since as early as the 17th c., it has been intricately tied up with commercial publishing interests, in particular educational publishing.  
3. Pitman published his first book of stenography in 1837.  By the 1880s, over a million copies of his books had been sold [we know this because he publishes the number of copies in print on the title page of each new edition!]!  
4.  Pitman's publishing endeavors were in more than some small part enabled by the start of the penny post in the UK in 1839, revealing the interconnections between government financing and private educational endeavors even in the early 19th c., i.e., as long as government funded educational initiatives have existed.   As evidence of the continuity between 19th, 20th, and 21st c. educational publishing, Pitman's publishing business was sold to Pearson Education in 1985 and in 2019, Pearson then sold its k-12 courseware business to Nexus Capital Management.  (Who ever said there was no intrigue in educational publishing?!?!?!!?!)
5. By the time Alexander Melville Bell gets involved shorthand instruction and the publishing and sale of educational materials related to it is already big business.   Herman Melville Bell was trying to replace and overtake Pitman's shorthand system with his.  What is interesting about Bell's system is that it is not only related to phonography, as Pitman's was, but it the writing system itself is based on a set of directions for operating the functions of the human body.  As I've written elsewhere, "What Melville Bell did was take existing systems and notions of shorthand and “fit” them to the human body in such a way that the speech organs became an instrument that were operated by graphic instructions."
6. Alexander Graham Bell was fluent in this writing system called Visible Speech and it was instrumental (pun intended!) in his research related to the development of the telephone. 
7. This is all so exciting to me because it documents the importance of printing technologies and writing instruments, pens, telegraphs, phonographs, typewriters, etc., to the development of later communications technologies and machine languages.  


HMB does several things.  He exploits the idea of writing as a control mechanism of speech, first to enable the deaf to communicate and later to assist those who speak in non-standard dialects to "fix" and "correct" their ways of speaking by making them conform to a standard English dialect.  We see this aspect of “Visible Speech” explored in "My Fair Lady" when Eliza is transformed socially by the merging of her writing and speaking dialects [Henry Higgins is based on Henry Sweet, who was a protégé of HMB].  HMB's use of his son, AGB, who is in some sense HMB's amanuensis, links writing as a control mechanism to telephonic communication.  The importance of visible speech to AGB's development of the telephone has been documented in his journals.  How literally (pun intended) we should interpret AGB's use of visible speech as a form of writing is open to interpretation.  What we do know is that graphic communication, at that time, was the only form of long distance communication available.  All of this is so exciting to me because for years I have been trying to develop an understanding of how relationships between speaking and writing are conceived of in writing instruction.  I now can say with some certainty that it is in the 18th c. that the separation of speech from writing in writing instructions begins and that it is in the 19th c. that this division is codified. [c.f. reference to Bell in ______’s book???

As one of the oldest information and communications technologies, systems of  shorthand offer a unique lens 
In the introduction to his __ book The Origins of Composition Studies in the American College, 1875–1925, John Brereton explains that “the composition course,” is very much a product of late-nineteenth century America, an “age of invention” and “reform impulses.”  To contextualize this invention, he mentions several contemporaneous ones, including the hydraulic elevator, the electric light, the telephone, and the phonograph.  However, he does not mention 19th c. systems of shorthand, technological inventions in themselves that informed both the communications technologies of the telephone and phonograph and the Harvard composition program itself.  

Shorthand has a long history in the west.  

I became interested in the topic of 19th c. systems of shorthand via the work of Lisa Gitelman, a media and technology historian, who teaches at NYU and whose work is amazing.  In one chapter of her 1990 book "Scripts, Grooves, and Writing Machines" she writes about different systems of shorthand being part of any number of "technologies of inscription" (such as the telegraph and the typewriter) contributing to the "climate of representation" in the 19th c. Although most of Gitelman's writing about shorthand is dedicated to Isaac Pitman's shorthand system, which was a huge commercial success throughout the 19th and 20th centuries (by 1888, over a million copies of Pitman's "Manual of Shorthand" had been sold), she also writes a bit about Alexander Melville Bell's shorthand system, which he called "Visible Speech."  Emerging after Pitman's system and from his work as an elocutionist, Melville Bell's system was particularly interesting to me because of my research into relationships between speaking and writing in the teaching of college writing and the representations of the relationship between the two modes of communication in college composition textbooks.  Having spent many years attempting to understand exactly how and why the interdiction to "never write as one speaks" became codified in writing instruction practices, textbooks, and folklore, I found that Melville Bell's writings on the separation of the two modes of communication were important ones.  

What initially drew me to Melville Bell's work was the visual interest of both the script itself and the graphic figures included with it to illustrate its operations.   The script of "Visible Speech" is itself very evocative, recalling in its sinuous shapes some phonetic language from the "Far East."  While I have not had a chance to study the orientalist influences on Bell's system of shorthand, I have no doubt that they exist.  As David Porter has explained in his 1993 book "Ideographia: The Chinese Cipher in Early Modern Europe," the "orientalist undercurrents" of 19th c. linguistics were very strong and continued well into the 20th c.  

The focus of my interest in "Visible Speech" related to its structure as a shorthand system that appeared to be one of the first to assign specific symbols to functions of the human body that were then used in the Visible Speech alphabet as instructions for the operation of the body.  While this in itself is pretty exciting as a moment in the history of writing studies, what is even more noteworthy is that Melville Bell's son, Alexander Graham Bell, was a fluent reader and speaker of "Visible Speech" and there is documentary evidence from his notebooks to indicate that he made use of "Visible Speech" in his research related to the development of the telephone.  Melville Bell evidently also gave his son a mandate to promote "Visible Speech" and Graham Bell did so via his work with the deaf and by commissioning any number of publications related to Visible Speech for the Volta Press, the press he owned.  As a result, the influence of Visible Speech, both in Melville Bell's lifetime and beyond, was secured.  How successful Visible Speech actually was, however, remains a point of some contention and, I believe, needs to be further researched.  The 1867 Visible Speech book was reviewed somewhat negatively by Whitney, one of the most important American linguists in the 19th c. and a professor at Yale.  However, the reception of Bell's work at Harvard was much warmer.  Then President Thomas Hill had read (and learned!) Visible Speech and through his connections, Melville Bell was invited to give the Lowell lectures at Harvard in Fall, 1868.  The dates are noteworthy, because it is around this time that the first composition program is coming into existence at Harvard.  How influential Visible Speech was in the composition program has not yet been researched and I'm not sure how much documentary evidence exists.  What we do have is Melville Bell's writings about language and written communication and many documents and publications from the composition program's founders, including a highly influential writing textbook authored by one of those founders, Adams Sherman Hill.  

To me, what is most interesting about "Visible Speech" is its reception/remediation in the 20th c. via Henry Sweet's work (a British linguist and the founder of the International Phonetic Alphabet) and the model for the character of Henry Higgins in George Bernard Shaw's "Pygmalion," its use in one film version of "My Fair Lady," and its overall legacy in common knowledge in terms of how relationships between speaking and writing are conceived in college writing and how it participates (either actually or via its fictionalized incarnation in Shaw's play) in the idea that social class and spoken language are not only correlated, but that change in social class may be effected by a change in one's language.  Obviously, self improvement, efficiency, and "pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps" were all part of a 19th c. ethos.  What I find particularly fascinating about Visible Speech is that itself is characterized (and later marketed) as possessing all three!  

So here is where I get into trouble with my proposal:  I have been very focused recently on understanding connections between Visible Speech and proto- or actual machine languages developed at Bell Labs in the 20th c.  However, it seems like I will have a stronger NYPL application by looking backward at different systems of shorthand (there are over 200!) rather than forward to the Bell Labs connections.  Obviously, I will want to write about connections between Visible Speech and Harvard's composition program, but I'm feeling some pressure (mostly internal) to make this a proposal about shorthand in general.  Even though I know this is way too large a subject for me to tackle, I will to some extent be writing about the history of shorthand as part of this project and that is its own totally fascinating topic.  The first book of printed shorthand is generally ascribed to Timothie Bright in 1588.  This is followed by many other publications of shorthand systems, all of which are intertwined with the history of the book and the history of vocational language education.  As I wrote in the paper I gave in Ireland this summer, the history of shorthand can be studied both diachronically, i.e., in specific periods, and synchronically, i.e., across time, to reveal things about the functional aspects of verbal language and its relationships to a range of social and material technologies.  

What if the reclining caret in the Unix command line can be connected to a mark signifying the emission of breath accompanying the formation of a spoken word in an 1867 manual of shorthand? What might these connections tell us about some of the many roles and functions of writing in the pasts, presents, and futures of computing machines?  While this may sound like an intriguing if somewhat implausible hypothesis, I hope to show that this connection between human and machine communication can be documented.  The story I plan to tell connects these two apparently disparate realms of communication (human/machine; print/digital) by tracing the remediation of spoken communication in Alexander Melville Bell’s system of shorthand, which he called Visible Speech, and its afterlives as a result of its influence in the technical, academic, and cultural imagination.  .
What connections might exist between a typographical symbol signifying the emission of breath used in the formation of a spoken word in a printed diagram from an 1867 manual of shorthand by Herman Melville Bell and its digital equivalent in the Unix command line?  

Could these graphical marks, despite their medial and temporal separation, be in some way related? 
 Graphically, there is no doubt that they can be connected: the greater than sign ( > ), as it is familiarly called, is a very common typographical mark used in any number of print and digital applications.  
But what about the provenance of these two specific tokens of this particular mark?  As it turns out, they both act as instructions for acts of communication and both originate from work associated with Bell Technical Labs.  
What is more, if we define Unix as a kind of “digital shorthand,” as the New York Times did in explaining its operations to a lay audience in a 2011 obituary of Dennis Ritchie, one of the authors of the Unix operating system, the possible connections between these two marks become all that more intriguing (Lohr).  
Seeking to better understand the many roles and functions of technologies of inscription and writing instruction in the pasts, presents, and futures of computing machines, I plan to explore the historical connections between human and machine communication by analyzing the conditions that gave rise to Herman Melville Bell’s system of shorthand, which he called “Visible Speech,” its roles in the development of new communications technologies in the mid- and late- nineteenth century U.S., and its afterlives as a result of its influence and remediation in the technical, academic, and cultural imagination. 
Systems of shorthand, like other nineteenth-century innovations in the area of inscriptive practice and information and communications technologies (ICT), such as the telegraph, typewriter, phonograph, and telephone can each be interpreted, as Lisa Gitelman has argued, as presenting their own unique “theories of language and textuality.”   
As composition instruction, writing practices, and scholarly activities in the twenty first century U.S. become more and more intertwined with digital technologies, the importance of understanding the genealogies of specific historical and contemporary ICTs, their intricate relations with the definitions and functions of verbal language, and the cultural, technical, and medial contexts in which they emerged have become increasingly important in the fields of the digital humanities and writing studies (Fuller, Haas, Heim, Kirschenbaum).  
Of course, some technologies of inscription have more influence than others.  Although emerging quite late in the history of printed shorthand systems, the first of which was published by Timothie Bright in 1588, Melville Bell’s “Visible Speech” shorthand system has several notable characteristics: 
	•	its emergence after the commercial success of Isaac Pitman’s shorthand system in vocational education (Pitman)

	•	the fact that Alexander Graham Bell, an inventor of numerous late nineteenth century communications technologies, was a fluent reader and speaker of his father’s shorthand system (A. G. Bell, H. M. Bell, Gitelman) 
	•	the interest and attention dedicated to it by Adam Sherman Hill, the President of Harvard College and one of the founders of the first composition program the U.S. (Hitz, Hill) 
	•	its influence on the study of phonetics in the field of English language teaching and linguistics, particularly via the work of Henry Sweet (Sweet)  
	•	its depictions in popular theatrical and film media via its roles in George Bernard Shaw’s 1905 play Pygmalion and the film versions of My Fair Lady based on it (Shoulson, Weizenbaum) 
	•	the ongoing research into Visible Speech and multimodal communications systems at Bell Technical Labs throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (Liu, Kopp, Potter, Ritchie, Shannon)

While the import and influence of Melville Bell’s “Visible Speech” have been notable in many technical and academic fields, research related to it in the fields of rhetoric and composition and writing studies has been scant.  
Having been engaged for many years in researching relationships between oral and written communication in college writing instruction with a particular focus on the ways and means by which it became commonplace to separate the two modes of communication, I was led to the work of Melville Bell as one early source where a clear demarcation of the two modes of communication are made.  
The potential importance of Bell’s shorthand system in the creation and evolution of college composition programs and the traces of it in a range of ICTs is, frankly, startling.  
Having first worked as an elocutionist who worked to improve the speech of individuals with a range of disabilities, including the deaf, by 1860, Bell conceives of written communication as a set of instructions for the production of sounds.  
In other words, the body itself becomes a writing instrument.  As such, Alexander Graham Bell’s use of “Visible Speech” in his research related to the development of the telephone connects old technologies of written inscriptions with new technologies of voice communication in much more explicit ways.  Further, the very rationale for Melville Bell’s system of shorthand, itself based on “curing” physical “disabilities” and automating verbal language production, are issues that have themselves been remediated and propagated through the establishment, evolution, and continuation of college composition programs in the late nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty first century U.S.   

Project Engagement With Collections at The New York Public Library’s Stephen A. Schwarzman Building  

Although digital copies of some important books in the history of shorthand are accessible via databases operated by The Hathi Trust, Early English Books Online, Archive.org, Google Books, and various national and international library collections, there is a wealth of material that has yet to be digitized.  Furthermore, one key hypothesis to be explored in this project is how definitions and conceptions of shorthand may change in relation to the specific representational and reproductive technologies available in a given period.  As a result, having the ability to work with and analyze books of shorthand as physical objects will be invaluable to the progress of this project.
While the majority of my research will be dedicated to the Beale Shorthand Collection (1640 – 1910), I also plan to consult the Jerome B. Howard shorthand collection (1710-1912; bulk dates 1838-1912), the National Shorthand Reporters Association Collection, the George Carl Mares Papers, and the Shorthand Miscellany Collection.  Of particular importance to this project are the following resources contained in the Beale Shorthand Collection: 
	•	Boxes 3 and 4, which contain Charles Currier Beale’s papers and manuscripts and promise to shed more light on the history of systems of shorthand in the colonial United States  

	•	Box 9, which contains a typewritten copy of Bright’s 1588 Characterie, the first printed book of shorthand in the West, and John Byrom’s notes on shorthand from his early eighteenth century journals 

	•	Box 14, which contains a list of the shorthand collection compiled by Julius Ensign Rockwell, a stenographer and the author of the several important publications on the history of shorthand

	•	Box 17, which contains John Willis’ The School-Maister (1622) and James Weston’s Stenography Completed (1727), two important books relative to shorthand’s connections to writing and language instruction and school grammars.

Within the Shorthand Miscellany Collection is a copy of Edmund Willis’ “An Abbreviation of Writing by Chracter” (1618), which has not been digitized and which contains a review of shorthand systems published by Bright, Bales, and John Willis.  Having the ability to utilize the library’s collection in the DeWitt Wallace Periodicals Room will enable my access to a number of important nineteenth and twentieth century serial publications dedicated to shorthand, stenography, and typewriting, particularly the Illustrated Phonographic World (serial; later entitled The Stenographer and Phonographic World: A Monthly Magazine Devoted to the Shorthand and Typewriting Professions).  Finally, I am hopeful that in using the library’s collections, I may also locate a copy of the first book of shorthand published in the United States 1728, Samuel Keimer’s Short-Hand Book, which I have been unable to locate in digital form.

Project Objectives, Outline and Work Plan 2020 – 2021
I plan to complete the draft of two chapters (I and II), which are already in progress, and begin drafting the third chapter (III) during my fellowship at the Cullman Center.  The projected work plan is as follows:  
I. Introduction to 19th c. Shorthand: The “Invention” of Visible Speech (September – December 2020)

II. Was AGB Raised as a Telephone?: The Applications and Import of Visible Speech in the 19th c. U.S. (December, 2020 – March, 2021)

III. The After Lives of Visible Speech: Reception and Remediation of Bell’s Shorthand System in the U.S. and Britain (April – May, 2021)

There has been a growing interest in the history of shorthand in relation to the history of computing machines (Liu), literary and book history (Bowles, Davidson), and writing studies (Harris, Haas).  However, the last comprehensive overview of shorthand was published in 1949 and was published, as most of its predecessors were, by Pitman publishing.  In the context of my own research into relationships between print and digital technologies and the roles of college writing instruction and commercial publishing in both, this project will contribute to the clarification of the roles of one specific ICT in the history of engineering and the history of writing education.

Cuttings
That the term literacy has, to date, uniformly positive connotations certainly offers one explanation for its ever expanding currency.  Another relates to the fact that the terms reading and writing, a knowledge of which defines the very state of being “literate,” are themselves such “productively ambiguous” ones (Heim 35) [1].
