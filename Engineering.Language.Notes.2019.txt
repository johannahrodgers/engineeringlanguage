Project Background

Understanding the assumptions about writing and literacy embedded in HMB’s short hand system allows us to trace these in the digital tools that are informed by this system of shorthand. 


The various elements of HMB’s shorthand system are themselves remediated in its traces and afterlives in writing instruction pedagogy, stage and film adaptations, and specific tools and applications for digital computing systems.

Shorthand in the 19th c. and HMB’s Visible Speech

1.  The history of what comes to be called shorthand in the 19th c. is long and very tightly intertwined with various technologies of reproduction, communication and distribution, i.e., letter press printing, sound recording, engraving, lithography, photography, the penny post, the telephone, and the phonograph.
2.  Further, since as early as the 17th c., it has been intricately tied up with commercial publishing interests, in particular educational publishing.  
3. Pitman published his first book of stenography in 1837.  By the 1880s, over a million copies of his books had been sold [we know this because he publishes the number of copies in print on the title page of each new edition!]!  
4.  Pitman's publishing endeavors were in more than some small part enabled by the start of the penny post in the UK in 1839, revealing the interconnections between government financing and private educational endeavors even in the early 19th c., i.e., as long as government funded educational initiatives have existed.   As evidence of the continuity between 19th, 20th, and 21st c. educational publishing, Pitman's publishing business was sold to Pearson Education in 1985 and in 2019, Pearson then sold its k-12 courseware business to Nexus Capital Management.  (Who ever said there was no intrigue in educational publishing?!?!?!!?!)
5. By the time Alexander Melville Bell gets involved shorthand instruction and the publishing and sale of educational materials related to it is already big business.   Herman Melville Bell was trying to replace and overtake Pitman's shorthand system with his.  What is interesting about Bell's system is that it is not only related to phonography, as Pitman's was, but it the writing system itself is based on a set of directions for operating the functions of the human body.  As I've written elsewhere, "What Melville Bell did was take existing systems and notions of shorthand and “fit” them to the human body in such a way that the speech organs became an instrument that were operated by graphic instructions."
6. Alexander Graham Bell was fluent in this writing system called Visible Speech and it was instrumental (pun intended!) in his research related to the development of the telephone. 
7. This is all so exciting to me because it documents the importance of printing technologies and writing instruments, pens, telegraphs, phonographs, typewriters, etc., to the development of later communications technologies and machine languages.  


HMB does several things.  He exploits the idea of writing as a control mechanism of speech, first to enable the deaf to communicate and later to assist those who speak in non-standard dialects to "fix" and "correct" their ways of speaking by making them conform to a standard English dialect.  We see this aspect of “Visible Speech” explored in "My Fair Lady" when Eliza is transformed socially by the merging of her writing and speaking dialects [Henry Higgins is based on Henry Sweet, who was a protégé of HMB].  HMB's use of his son, AGB, who is in some sense HMB's amanuensis, links writing as a control mechanism to telephonic communication.  The importance of visible speech to AGB's development of the telephone has been documented in his journals.  How literally (pun intended) we should interpret AGB's use of visible speech as a form of writing is open to interpretation.  What we do know is that graphic communication, at that time, was the only form of long distance communication available.  All of this is so exciting to me because for years I have been trying to develop an understanding of how relationships between speaking and writing are conceived of in writing instruction.  I now can say with some certainty that it is in the 18th c. that the separation of speech from writing in writing instructions begins and that it is in the 19th c. that this division is codified. [c.f. reference to Bell in ______’s book??? C.f. Howell’s Grammar; c.f. Lily’s grammar


 

Emerging after Pitman's system and from his work as an elocutionist, Melville Bell's system was particularly interesting to me because of my research into relationships between speaking and writing in the teaching of college writing and the representations of the relationship between the two modes of communication in college composition textbooks.  Having spent many years attempting to understand exactly how and why the interdiction to "never write as one speaks" became codified in writing instruction practices, textbooks, and folklore, I found that Melville Bell's writings on the separation of the two modes of communication were important ones.  

What initially drew me to Melville Bell's work was the visual interest of both the script itself and the graphic figures included with it to illustrate its operations.   The script of "Visible Speech" is itself very evocative, recalling in its sinuous shapes some phonetic language from the "Far East."  While I have not had a chance to study the orientalist influences on Bell's system of shorthand, I have no doubt that they exist.  As David Porter has explained in his 1993 book "Ideographia: The Chinese Cipher in Early Modern Europe," the "orientalist undercurrents" of 19th c. linguistics were very strong and continued well into the 20th c.  

The focus of my interest in "Visible Speech" related to its structure as a shorthand system that appeared to be one of the first to assign specific symbols to functions of the human body that were then used in the Visible Speech alphabet as instructions for the operation of the body.  While this in itself is pretty exciting as a moment in the history of writing studies, what is even more noteworthy is that Melville Bell's son, Alexander Graham Bell, was a fluent reader and speaker of "Visible Speech" and there is documentary evidence from his notebooks to indicate that he made use of "Visible Speech" in his research related to the development of the telephone.  Melville Bell evidently also gave his son a mandate to promote "Visible Speech" and Graham Bell did so via his work with the deaf and by commissioning any number of publications related to Visible Speech for the Volta Press, the press he owned.  As a result, the influence of Visible Speech, both in Melville Bell's lifetime and beyond, was secured.  How successful Visible Speech actually was, however, remains a point of some contention and, I believe, needs to be further researched.  The 1867 Visible Speech book was reviewed somewhat negatively by Whitney, one of the most important American linguists in the 19th c. and a professor at Yale.  However, the reception of Bell's work at Harvard was much warmer.  Then President Thomas Hill had read (and learned!) Visible Speech and through his connections, Melville Bell was invited to give the Lowell lectures at Harvard in Fall, 1868.  The dates are noteworthy, because it is around this time that the first composition program is coming into existence at Harvard.  How influential Visible Speech was in the composition program has not yet been researched and I'm not sure how much documentary evidence exists.  What we do have is Melville Bell's writings about language and written communication and many documents and publications from the composition program's founders, including a highly influential writing textbook authored by one of those founders, Adams Sherman Hill.  

To me, what is most interesting about "Visible Speech" is its reception/remediation in the 20th c. via Henry Sweet's work (a British linguist and the founder of the International Phonetic Alphabet) and the model for the character of Henry Higgins in George Bernard Shaw's "Pygmalion," its use in one film version of "My Fair Lady," and its overall legacy in common knowledge in terms of how relationships between speaking and writing are conceived in college writing and how it participates (either actually or via its fictionalized incarnation in Shaw's play) in the idea that social class and spoken language are not only correlated, but that change in social class may be effected by a change in one's language.  Obviously, self improvement, efficiency, and "pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps" were all part of a 19th c. ethos.  What I find particularly fascinating about Visible Speech is that itself is characterized (and later marketed) as possessing all three!  

So here is where I get into trouble with my proposal:  I have been very focused recently on understanding connections between Visible Speech and proto- or actual machine languages developed at Bell Labs in the 20th c.  However, it seems like I will have a stronger NYPL application by looking backward at different systems of shorthand (there are over 200!) rather than forward to the Bell Labs connections.  Obviously, I will want to write about connections between Visible Speech and Harvard's composition program, but I'm feeling some pressure (mostly internal) to make this a proposal about shorthand in general.  Even though I know this is way too large a subject for me to tackle, I will to some extent be writing about the history of shorthand as part of this project and that is its own totally fascinating topic.  The first book of printed shorthand is generally ascribed to Timothie Bright in 1588.  This is followed by many other publications of shorthand systems, all of which are intertwined with the history of the book and the history of vocational language education.  As I wrote in the paper I gave in Ireland this summer, the history of shorthand can be studied both diachronically, i.e., in specific periods, and synchronically, i.e., across time, to reveal things about the functional aspects of verbal language and its relationships to a range of social and material technologies.  

What if the reclining caret in the Unix command line can be connected to a mark signifying the emission of breath accompanying the formation of a spoken word in an 1867 manual of shorthand? What might these connections tell us about some of the many roles and functions of writing in the pasts, presents, and futures of computing machines?  While this may sound like an intriguing if somewhat implausible hypothesis, I hope to show that this connection between human and machine communication can be documented.  The story I plan to tell connects these two apparently disparate realms of communication (human/machine; print/digital) by tracing the remediation of spoken communication in Alexander Melville Bell’s system of shorthand, which he called Visible Speech, and its afterlives as a result of its influence in the technical, academic, and cultural imagination.  .
What connections might exist between a typographical symbol signifying the emission of breath used in the formation of a spoken word in a printed diagram from an 1867 manual of shorthand by Herman Melville Bell and its digital equivalent in the Unix command line?  

Could these graphical marks, despite their medial and temporal separation, be in some way related? 
 Graphically, there is no doubt that they can be connected: the greater than sign ( > ), as it is familiarly called, is a very common typographical mark used in any number of print and digital applications.  
But what about the provenance of these two specific tokens of this particular mark?  As it turns out, they both act as instructions for acts of communication and both originate from work associated with Bell Technical Labs.  
What is more, if we define Unix as a kind of “digital shorthand,” as the New York Times did in explaining its operations to a lay audience in a 2011 obituary of Dennis Ritchie, one of the authors of the Unix operating system, the possible connections between these two marks become all that more intriguing (Lohr).  
Seeking to better understand the many roles and functions of technologies of inscription and writing instruction in the pasts, presents, and futures of computing machines, I plan to explore the historical connections between human and machine communication by analyzing the conditions that gave rise to Herman Melville Bell’s system of shorthand, which he called “Visible Speech,” its roles in the development of new communications technologies in the mid- and late- nineteenth century U.S., and its afterlives as a result of its influence and remediation in the technical, academic, and cultural imagination. 
Systems of shorthand, like other nineteenth-century innovations in the area of inscriptive practice and information and communications technologies (ICT), such as the telegraph, typewriter, phonograph, and telephone can each be interpreted, as Lisa Gitelman has argued, as presenting their own unique “theories of language and textuality.”   
As composition instruction, writing practices, and scholarly activities in the twenty first century U.S. become more and more intertwined with digital technologies, the importance of understanding the genealogies of specific historical and contemporary ICTs, their intricate relations with the definitions and functions of verbal language, and the cultural, technical, and medial contexts in which they emerged have become increasingly important in the fields of the digital humanities and writing studies (Fuller, Haas, Heim, Kirschenbaum).  
Of course, some technologies of inscription have more influence than others.  Although emerging quite late in the history of printed shorthand systems, the first of which date to Classical Greece, Melville Bell’s “Visible Speech” shorthand system has several notable characteristics: 
	•	its emergence after the commercial success of Isaac Pitman’s shorthand system in vocational education (Pitman)

	•	the fact that Alexander Graham Bell, an inventor of numerous late nineteenth century communications technologies, was a fluent reader and speaker of his father’s shorthand system (A. G. Bell, H. M. Bell, Gitelman) 
	•	the interest and attention dedicated to it by Adam Sherman Hill, the President of Harvard College and one of the founders of the first composition program the U.S. (Hitz, Hill) 
	•	its influence on the study of phonetics in the field of English language teaching and linguistics, particularly via the work of Henry Sweet (Sweet)  
	•	its depictions in popular theatrical and film media via its roles in George Bernard Shaw’s 1905 play Pygmalion and the film versions of My Fair Lady based on it (Shoulson, Weizenbaum) 
	•	the ongoing research into Visible Speech and multimodal communications systems at Bell Technical Labs throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (Liu, Kopp, Potter, Ritchie, Shannon)

While the import and influence of Melville Bell’s “Visible Speech” have been notable in many technical and academic fields, research related to it in the fields of rhetoric and composition and writing studies has been scant.  
Having been engaged for many years in researching relationships between oral and written communication in college writing instruction with a particular focus on the ways and means by which it became commonplace to separate the two modes of communication, I was led to the work of Melville Bell as one early source where a clear demarcation of the two modes of communication are made.  
The potential importance of Bell’s shorthand system in the creation and evolution of college composition programs and the traces of it in a range of ICTs is, frankly, startling.  
Having first worked as an elocutionist who worked to improve the speech of individuals with a range of disabilities, including the deaf, by 1860, Bell conceives of written communication as a set of instructions for the production of sounds.  
In other words, the body itself becomes a writing instrument.  As such, Alexander Graham Bell’s use of “Visible Speech” in his research related to the development of the telephone connects old technologies of written inscriptions with new technologies of voice communication in much more explicit ways.  Further, the very rationale for Melville Bell’s system of shorthand, itself based on “curing” physical “disabilities” and automating verbal language production, are issues that have themselves been remediated and propagated through the establishment, evolution, and continuation of college composition programs in the late nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty first century U.S.   

“I chose the name ELIZA for the language analysis program because, like the Eliza of Pygmalion fame, it could be taught to ‘speak’ increasingly well.  Because conversations must be about something, that is because they must take place within some context, the program was constructed in a two-tier arrangement, the first tier consisting of the language analyzer and the second of a script.  The script is a set of rules rather like those that might be given to an actor who is to use them to improvise around a certain theme.  Thus ELIZA could be given a script to enable it to maintain a conversation about cooking eggs or about managing a bank checking account, and so on.  Each specific script enabled ELIZA to play a specific conversational role.  For my first experiment, I gave ELIZA a script designed to permit it to play (I should really say parody) the role of a Rogerian psychotherapist engaged in an initial interview with a patient.”

Project Significance

There has been a growing interest in the history of shorthand in relation to the history of computing machines (Liu), literary and book history (Bowles, Davidson), and writing studies (Harris, Haas).  However, the last comprehensive overview of shorthand was published in 1949 and was published, as most of its predecessors were, by Pitman publishing.  In the context of my own research into relationships between print and digital technologies and the roles of college writing instruction and commercial publishing in both, this project will contribute to the clarification of the roles of one specific ICT in the history of engineering and the history of writing education.

That the term literacy has, to date, uniformly positive connotations certainly offers one explanation for its ever expanding currency.  Another relates to the fact that the terms reading and writing, a knowledge of which defines the very state of being “literate,” are themselves such “productively ambiguous” ones (Heim 35) [1].

Although we may use this word “writing” on an almost daily basis, the many different things connoted and denoted by this one term are often overlooked.  In Writing is a book that considers how many things are actually involved with and referred to in this one term, writing, which, depending on the context in which it is used, can refer to the process of shaping and transcribing ideas via words or other signs and symbols, the texts that are made up of symbolic inscriptions, or the conventions and genres that are associated with the production and reception of texts.   While many people still associate writing primarily with acts and texts related to the representation of verbal language, as our ability to communicate easily with signs other than inscribed verbal language, or words, increases, this term writing only takes on further meaning.   This is a book dedicated to defining and investigating the discrete elements of writing and to thinking about how the media we use in the creation, production, and distribution of writing relate to how writing happens and what writing may mean.  Functioning at once as a graphical, logical, and poetic sign system, verbal language, which is transmitted by writing in different media, has unique properties depending on the medium or media employed for its dissemination (Drucker).  In this project, I investigate the specific functions of writing across four distinct medial environments--handwriting, typewriting, word processing, and javascript—in order to explore the shared and divergent properties of verbal language in each.

Investigating and defining the representational affordances and functions of verbal language are topics that have been addressed consistently by writers, artists, and philosophers since antiquity.  In the sixth century B.C. E., Heraclitus considered the relationships between verbal language and logos, or public understanding, (Kahn) and in the fifth century B.C.E., Plato warned of the potential danger of writing distorting our understandings and perceptions of reality   (“Phaedrus”).  By the first century B.C.E., it was questions about writing’s properties as a representational medium in relation to other representational media, such as painting, that Horace addressed in his Ars Poetica.  This question of how writing relates to other representational media is one that is again taken up during the Renaissance and the Enlightenment in Europe and continues to occupy the attention of cultural critics today.  Part of the reason that questions about verbal language are of such consistent interest is that the definitions and functions of verbal language exist in relation to the technologies available for its dissemination.

In the twenty first century United States, we have arrived at a moment when definitions of writing are being expanded to include communication via media other than words, i.e., pictures and sounds, while, at the same time, the majority of verbal communicative acts increasingly involves the use of machines. As we spend more and more of our time writing with machines and having our words processed automatically, we are quickly approaching a time when automated composition will no longer be a fiction, but a reality.  While the media critic Neil Postman suggests, like Marshall Macluhan, that we are entering a time of “secondary orality,” we are still in the process of figuring out what the implications of such secondary orality may mean for the ways in which words are defined and processed literacy instruction generally and college writing instruction specifically.   While it is generally agreed that relationships between speaking and writing are being refigured in a “digital age,” the terms and concepts available to describe these reconfigurations are still in the process of being worked out.  The word, however undefined as a category, is one point of contact between written an oral communication.        

Despite the explicitly stated importance of communication to the fields of cybernetics and infromation processing (Wiener), the field of media and writing studies continues to play catch up in its ability to adequately theorize and describe the roles and functions inscribed verbal communication.  As the linguist Roy Harris pointed out in his book “Rethinking Writing,” although, in the field of mathematics, there has long been a distinction made between a notation, i.e., a figure, and a script, “there is no such simple and perspicuous statement available in the cases of language” (94).  This inadequacy results, in part, from the very breadth of the field (doubtful) as well as its intertwinement with the reality we live in , i.e., we can only talk about reality using language.  However, the need to articulate exactly what is going on with literacy practices and how today’s multimodal and highly automated acts of communication relate to the current practices and histories of college writing instruction make it important to flesh out what has not been fleshed out in writing studies.  Systems of shorthand, which are one of the oldest technologies of inscription for recording, reproducing, and storing verbal language offer a repository for better understanding the instrumental elements of verbal language and its adaptations in digital environments. Verbal=spoken, alphabetic, instrumental

The alphabet is a notational system for recording verbal concepts.  

Notation=eastern v. western arabic numerals
Writing system=arabic decimal v. octal

A numeral system (or system of numeration) is a writing system for expressing numbers; that is, a mathematical notation for representing numbers of a given set, using digits or other symbols in a consistent manner.
 
“A mathematical notation is a writing system used for recording concepts in mathematics. The notation uses symbols or symbolic expressions which are intended to have a precise semantic meaning. In the history of mathematics, these symbols have denoted numbers, shapes, patterns, and change.” (Wikipedia, Accessed September 11, 2019)

“A writing system is a method of visually representing verbal communication. While both writing and speech are useful in conveying messages, writing differs in also being a reliable form of information storage and transfer.[1] Writing systems require shared understanding between writers and readers of the meaning behind the sets of characters that make up a script.”

In 1668 John Wilkins in An Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language proposed use of base 8 instead of 10 "because the way of Dichotomy or Bipartition being the most natural and easie kind of Division, that Number is capable of this down to an Unite".[4]

The octal and hexadecimal systems are often used in computing because of their ease as shorthand for binary. Every hexadecimal digit corresponds to a sequence of four binary digits, since sixteen is the fourth power of two; for example, hexadecimal 7816 is binary 11110002. Similarly, every octal digit corresponds to a unique sequence of three binary digits, since eight is the cube of two.

I'm writing about systems of shorthand alphabets--one of the oldest information and communications technologies--to illustrate its impact on the history of composition programs, which is significant because some unique aspects of Bell's system continue to inform writing instruction and writing machines into the 20th c. such as writing instruction as a set of instructions, written communication as being separated from spoken communication, conceiving of the human body as an instrument in general and a writing instrument in particular, the afterlives of HMB's system in media, popular culture, and the public imagination. Visible Speech and shorthand in general is important to understanding the histories and presents of the college composition course in the U.S.  While there has been a lot written about the foundation of the Harvard Composition program, I am focusing on its pre-history in the 1860s and, specifically, showing how via Melville Bell's work, writing became an applied science at Harvard. In terms of the history of communications technologies and digital computers, this early definition of writing as an applied science is very interesting, especially in conjunction with the understanding that, shorthand itself grows out of an urge to standardize verbal language. The history of shorthand in the 17th c. can, I believe tell us something about the tensions that still exist.

What was a system of ciphers becomes one about standardization and later about speed and accuracy. It shows how technologies evolve. An instrument used across time in different climates of representation shows how definitions and functions of verbal language are in relation to available media.

Alphabetic literacy has had a very long run. Though challenged over the years by alternate writing systems, the alphabet has had a preternatural life. Embedded in educational and publishing systems since the 15th c., it is only in the 21st c that its status as a standard is being seriously question. As far as standards go, the alphabet has had a very long run.


Yesterday, I learned a bit about the role of early shorthand systems in attempts to control and standardize/clarify written expression.  What struck me yesterday was: 1/ the differences between how numeric and verbal figuration is conceived in the 17th c., and 2/ the reconfiguration of relationships between speaking and writing from the 17th to the 19th centuries.  In the 17th c., there is a perceived need to attach signification to real things in order to control and standardize it.  The “real character” that systems of shorthand seek is about finding a one to one correspondence between words and things.  It is fundamentally an anti-scholastic and anti-rhetorical bias.  Meaning must be correlated to the real world.  Rhetoric is a distraction and an obfuscation.  Figures of speech impede communication.  
 
I also learned yesterday why Latin was not perceived to be the answer to a universal language by those interested in creating a "common tongue."  It took too long to learn, it was not "concrete" enough, i.e., still subject to figures of speech and figuration, and _______ (Knowlson).  In the 17th c., the "common tongue" is glorified, and the classical criticized.  What I began to see yesterday was that in the 17th c., math education became, conceptually, the standard for all education.  With math, there could be a one to one correspondence between signs and things.  Math allowed for a system of signification that was artificially closed.  
 
It is interesting that even in the 19th c., Babbage is still struggling with the same issues of ambiguity and correlation in relation to alphabetic verbal communication, albeit in the context of machine operations.  [The question arises of why these issues were not resolved despite all of the time and attention paid to them between, let's say, Wilkins and Babbage].  Babbage's question was: How do you describe the operations of a machine in such a way as to accurately represent them?  His answer was to develop a system of shorthand to document its operations; again, his answer is to develop a system of one to one correspondence so there can be no ambiguity in signification.  
 
Why can't we agree on a common language?  Wouldn't it make the world an easier and more manageable place to live?  The Royal Society attempted to manage language in such a way to optimize clarity.  It would be interesting to look at the ways in which it did that by analyzing the words that were allowed to be used in their publications.  But that is a different project. 
 
My project relates to shorthand and the foundation of the college composition course at Harvard.  I am interested in the prehistory of the composition course and how it was shaped by this particular technology.  Shorthand alphabets are one of the older ICTs.  Shorthand was, initially, a scientific language.  But by the 19th c., it became an instrument in a different sense of the word.  
 
How did the composition course become one that is about instructions for writing?  May HMB's shorthand system have in some way contributed to this definition and formulation of the course?  How does HMB's Visible Speech relate to other systems of shorthand?  How does it differ?

stenos=narrow, close

Shorthand is called shorthand not only because it is meant to be quick but because it is meant to be concise.  Brachyography, narrow writing, because of its narrowness of meaning.  Exactitude.  No ambiguity.  Shorthand was, in the 17th c., a universal writing system.  By the 19th c., it becomes a recording system.  

A universal language was meant to only be written and possibly spoken.  Its main intent was to create a truly common universal language and establish a connection between words and things.  In developing these systems, philosophers (was Wilkins a philosopher?) wanted to get away from rhetoric and move to a new science of representation, documentation, and communication.  

Both Hobbes and Bacon write about language as currency.

I became interested in the topic of 19th c. systems of shorthand via the work of Lisa Gitelman, a media and technology historian, who teaches at NYU and whose work is amazing.  In one chapter of her 1990 book "Scripts, Grooves, and Writing Machines" she writes about different systems of shorthand being part of any number of "technologies of inscription" (such as the telegraph and the typewriter) contributing to the "climate of representation" in the 19th c. Although most of Gitelman's writing about shorthand is dedicated to Isaac Pitman's shorthand system, which was a huge commercial success throughout the 19th and 20th centuries (by 1888, over a million copies of Pitman's "Manual of Shorthand" had been sold), she also writes a bit about Alexander Melville Bell's shorthand system, which he called "Visible Speech."  Emerging after Pitman's system and from his work as an elocutionist, Melville Bell's system was particularly interesting to me because of my research into relationships between speaking and writing in the teaching of college writing and the representations of the relationship between the two modes of communication in college composition textbooks.  Having spent many years attempting to understand exactly how and why the interdiction to "never write as one speaks" became codified in writing instruction practices, textbooks, and folklore, I found that Melville Bell's writings on the separation of the two modes of communication were important ones.

To me, what is most interesting about "Visible Speech" is its reception/remediation in the 20th c. via Henry Sweet's work (a British linguist and the founder of the International Phonetic Alphabet) and the model for the character of Henry Higgins in George Bernard Shaw's "Pygmalion," its use in one film version of "My Fair Lady," and its overall legacy in common knowledge in terms of how relationships between speaking and writing are conceived in college writing and how it participates (either actually or via its fictionalized incarnation in Shaw's play) in the idea that social class and spoken language are not only correlated, but that change in social class may be effected by a change in one's language.  Obviously, self improvement, efficiency, and "pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps" were all part of a 19th c. ethos.  What I find particularly fascinating about Visible Speech is that itself is characterized (and later marketed) as possessing all three!  

So here is where I get into trouble with my proposal:  I have been very focused recently on understanding connections between Visible Speech and proto- or actual machine languages developed at Bell Labs in the 20th c.  However, it seems like I will have a stronger NYPL application by looking backward at different systems of shorthand (there are over 200!) rather than forward to the Bell Labs connections.  Obviously, I will want to write about connections between Visible Speech and Harvard's composition program, but I'm feeling some pressure (mostly internal) to make this a proposal about shorthand in general.  Even though I know this is way too large a subject for me to tackle, I will to some extent be writing about the history of shorthand as part of this project and that is its own totally fascinating topic.  The first book of printed shorthand is generally ascribed to Timothie Bright in 1588.  This is followed by many other publications of shorthand systems, all of which are intertwined with the history of the book and the history of vocational language education.  As I wrote in the paper I gave in Ireland this summer, the history of shorthand can be studied both diachronically, i.e., in specific periods, and synchronically, i.e., across time, to reveal things about the functional aspects of verbal language and its relationships to a range of social and material technologies.  



As an interdisciplinary project dedicated to bridging research in the sciences, social sciences, and the humanities, Engineering Language: Teaching Machines to Read and Write in the US and Britain (---- – ----) investigates relationships and dynamics amongst definitions of verbal language and the development of computational and communications systems to better understand interactions amongst social and material technologies and to establish an open access archive of key documents related to the definitions and conceptions of verbal language from 1826 - 1976.  Seeking to elucidate the interconnections amongst social and material technologies related to text processing, the project focuses on the roles and definitions of writing and its many functions (communicational, educational, commercial, political) in the history and evolution of computational systems.  While the importance of writing in computational systems has been acknowledged by scholars in computer science and the digital humanities (Winograd/Flores, Kirschenbaum) the specific ways in which writing has been inscribed in and functions in computational systems has yet to be fully elucidated and documented.    

to the development of 19th c. communications technologies, particularly Alexander Graham Bell’s telephone, as well as the longer term implications of this notational/writing system in conceptions of language and information processing at Bell Labs in the 20th c. relationships between writing and speaking, a “contact zone” mediated by different technologies of representation and socio-economic systems.  The project documents the definitions and functions of verbal language in the history of capitalism to better understand the ways in which relationships between humans and machines are mediated by social and material technologies.  

Social, economic, and material technologies 

A project that is fundamentally about the ways in which new technologies are informed and shaped by old technologies and documenting the material and social metamorphses that occur in the process, the project seeks to make the roles and functions of writing in computational systems visible to a new generation of scholars who will then be invited to use the resources collected in their own research.

The theory behind this project is not new.  The influence of the 17th c. (Bacon, Leibniz) in the theoretical and applied sciences is unquestioned.  However, the pathways and feedback loops connecting the theoretical sciences to the applied sciences, commercial industry, government funded initiatives and programs (military, educational, environmental), and academic disciplines outside of the sciences remain largely uncharted.  This project seeks to use the printed archive (commercial, popular, and academic) to map these connections and to document the roles of technologies of inscription, reproduction, and distribution in shaping socio-cultural and technological phenomena.

 HMB did several things.  He exploits the idea of writing as a control mechanism of speech, first to enable the deaf to communicate and later to assist those who speak in non-standard dialects to "fix" and "correct" their ways of speaking by making them conform to ways of writing.  We see this in "My Fair Lady" when Eliza is transformed socially by the merging of her writing and speaking dialects.  HMB's use of his son, AGB, who is in some sense HMB's amanuensis, links writing as a control mechanism to telephonic communication.  The importance of visible speech to AGB's development of the telephone has been documented in his journals.  How literally (pun intended) we should interpret AGB's use of visible speech as a form of writing is open to interpretation.  What we do know is that graphic communication, at that time, was the only form of long distance communication available.  All of this is so exciting to me because for years I have been trying to develop an understanding of how relationships between speaking and writing are conceived of in writing instruction.  I now can say with some certainty that it is in the 18th c. that it begins and in the 19th c. that it is codified.

What Melville Bell did was take existing systems and notions of shorthand and “fit” them to the human body in such a way that the speech organs became instruments that could be operated through graphic instructions.


OK.  So the argument that I want to make is that after the war, the government spent more money on teaching machines to read and write than teaching humans to read and write.  How much was spent on the GI bill compared to military sponsored research and development?  This is obviously not a zero sum game; government spending on education and government spending on the defense industry/private industry are intertwined.



This project is coming into focus as one that is about instrumentality and conceptions of writing.  While it is clear that issues related to instrumentality and language date to the advent of print and particularly to Bacon in the 17th c., I am working with a narrower though still large period, i.e., 1860-1960.  In 1860, Herman Melville Bell conceives of written communication as a set of instructions for the production of sounds.  The body itself becomes a writing instrument.  AGB uses HMB’s method to develop the telephone and visible speech continues to be studied at Bell Labs throughout the 20th c.    Additionally, there are several very important articles published in the Bell Labs Technical Journal related to how verbal language and communication are defined.  I believe there is a very interesting story to tell about how the various threads of the private industry, government funding, higher ed writing instruction fit together.  What is most exciting, is I seem to be finally putting together the evidence required to show how that, in fact, the U.S. government dedicated more funding to teaching machines to read and write than to teaching humans to read and write in the middle of the 20th c.  

There are several different ways to present this story, but they are all very interesting.  One is to trace the history of a graphic symbol from HMB’s visible speech charts in 1867 to the development of Unix in 1967.  This is a visual project.  Another way to tell the story is to assemble the document trail in the Bell Labs Technical Journal.  One other way is to describe all of the threads that need to be collected and really focus on definitions of verbal language in the early part of the 20th c..  This is when Basic English is developed and when crossword puzzles (December 21, 1913) and Scrabble are invented.

Regarding my writing, which continues to be mostly image based non-verbal output, here's what I've learned: 

1.  The history of shorthand is long and very tightly intertwined with various technologies of reproduction, communication and distribution, i.e., letter press printing, sound recording, engraving, lithography, photography, the penny post, the telephone, the internet.
2.  Further, since at least the 17th c., it has been intricately tied up with commercial interests, in particular educational publishing.  
3. By the time Alexander Melville Bell gets involved shorthand instruction and the publishing and sale of educational materials related to it is already big business.   Pitman published his first book of stenography in 1837.  By the 1880s, over a million copies of his books had been sold!  
4.  Pitman's publishing endeavors were in some part financed by the start of the penny post in the UK in 1839, which is interesting because it indicates that government financing of private educational corporations dates to the early 19th c., i.e., as long as government funded educational initiatives have existed.   As evidence of the continuity between 19th, 20th, and 21st c. educational publishing, Pitman's publishing business was sold to Pearson Education in 1985 and in 2019, Pearson then sold its k-12 courseware business to Nexus Capital Management.  (Who ever said there was no intrigue in educational publishing?!?!?!!?!)
5. Herman Melville Bell was trying to replace and overtake Pitman's shorthand system with his.  What is interesting about Bell's system is that it is not only related to phonography, as Pitman's was, but fits the notational writing system to functions of the human body.  As I've written elsewhere, "What Melville Bell did was take existing systems and notions of shorthand and “fit” them to the human body in such a way that the speech organs became an instrument that were operated by graphic means."
6. Alexander Graham Bell was fluent in this notational language called Visible Speech and it was instrumental (pun intended!) in his research related to the development of the telephone. 
7. This is all so exciting to me because it documents the importance of printing technologies and writing instruments, both pens and typewriters, to the development of later communications technologies and machine languages.  

Teaching Machines to Read and Write

I’ve been arguing for some time that our current socio-educational and economic condition seems to indicate that the U.S. government must have invested more money in the 20th c. teaching machines to read and write than teaching humans. However, it is only recently that I’ve been able to instantiate this claim with concrete evidence.  The vast amounts of money spent on information processing grants to universities in the post-war period is not at all hard to document.  However, what has been more difficult is breaking down the machine learning process.  The distinct steps and stages if you will by which computing machines were “taught” to read and write verbal language, or, as they refer to it in the information sciences, text.   

“The first distance education course in the modern sense was provided by Sir Isaac Pitman in the 1840s, who taught a system of shorthand by mailing texts transcribed into shorthand on postcards and receiving transcriptions from his students in return for correction. The element of student feedback was a crucial innovation of Pitman's system. This scheme was made possible by the introduction of uniform postage rates across Britain in 1840.” (Wikipedia)

I began the day looking at my investments and then at social media.  Around 10:30 I moved to the big computer and started thinking again about Dispatches From an Uncertain Future and not thinking about the NEH grant and the Tripwire article.  In thinking about Dispatches, I began looking for the book about the “utopian” Belle Isle development in Detroit.  I had thought that I had saved a copy of that, but it turns out that I had not.  In fact, I don’t know if the text is available for free.  There is a link below to where it can be purchased.  Nevertheless, I located the bibliographic info and found some parts of it.  It is a surprisingly well written narrative!  I had thought that I might re-write the text, but it seems so coherent and “acceptable” that I don’t know that that will work.  What does stand out as somewhat extraordinary are the author’s comments about the development and what he envisions for it.  It is a libertarian “utopia” that is planned.  Is that an oxymoron?  As I was searching for this, I came across a very old short story of mine entitled “Detroit,” which was, much to my surprise both not that bad and complete!  I was more impressed with it than I had ever been in the past. Is this because I write so little these days?  After that, I started thinking about the tripwire piece, which will include my QR code alphabet and some illustrations or texts from one of the numerous visible speech publications.  The inclusion in the Volta Bureau illustrated edition of an excerpt from a Hans Christian Andersen story entitled “The Flax” is particularly interesting to me, both in terms of the original story and in terms of how it is excerpted for the visible speech manual.  It is a very sad story about a flax plant that has great ambitions in the world and does not seem to have adequate appreciation for its natural attributes beauty.  As a result, the flax is delighted to be uprooted and turned into linen, which is then turned into paper, and then finally burned.  There are further traces of industrialization in the story:  the “snipp, snapp, snorum” rhyme, which is repeated twice in the story, appears to be nonsense, but actually refers to a cluster of towns that were developed for mining purposes (http://www.howderfamily.com/blog/snipp-snapp-snorum/
).  Andersen wrote the story in 1848, which seems like a significant date to me, particularly in relation to flax and linen and how both are featured in Marx’s Capital (date of composition?).  

The afternoon was spent thinking more about the NEH grant and reading Kittler’s essay on Code and Matthew Fuller’s book “Software Studies” in which that essay appears and “Media Ecologies.”  I have never read either and I should.  I also came across an introduction to a course about Turing and art that included a translation of Kittler’s introduction to his collection of Turing’s papers.  Kittler’s redux of Turing’s comment about the relationships between the physical sciences and language/cryptography in his essay “Code (or How You Can Write Something Differently)”, left me thinking about the astrolabe and the index and how language and the physical sciences mutually inform one another [are really one and the same].  I’d like to make this point, but it seems like a difficult one to clarify.  I suppose the afternoon related to the morning in the sense that I was able to say at the end of the day that the alphabet is a code and is itself an information and communications technology that facilitates storage and preservation.  

What Melville Bell did was take existing systems and notions of shorthand and “fit” them to the human body in such a way that the speech organs became an instrument.

Was Alexander Graham Bell Raised As a Telephone?  Technologies of Writing and Speaking in the 19th c. U.S. and Britain

Frankly beautiful, the curved, carving-like strokes of Alexander Melville Bell’s “universal language,” which he called Visible Speech, may remind most contemporary readers of what some, anachronistically, still refer to as “Siamese,” one written script of the Tai-Kadai language family that most of Americans have seen at some point on a Thai takeout menu.  Though actually resembling Sinhalese characters in their curvaceous notation even more than Thai characters, the Visible Speech “alphabet” by default maintains some type of connection to these tonal languages by virtue of the fact that it is based on a standardized graphic transcriptions of shorthand notations describing the discrete functions of the human speech organs.  Was Alexander Melville Bell familiar with south Asian language scripts in general or Sinhalese or “Siamese” scripts particularly?  As an elocutionist, a 19th c. term for one who studied language production, it is quite likely, though the question of whether Visible Speech is in any way derived from these languages is a much more difficult question to answer. 

 
How Processed Do You Like Your Humans?

To sound like yourself in writing is not to speak as you write but to write as you speak [this is not quite right.  What I mean to say is “voice” is a construct in writing, a hybrid of speech with writing].  Voice becomes “Voice.”  Visible speech is the standardization of the natural.  A mechanization of the natural.  The codification of breath/life.  A human becomes replicable once its discrete components are understood.  

Was AGB raised as a telephone?  The short answer is “yes.” The longer answer is also “yes,” though it involves a lot of explanation.

[I am interested in writing this paper because I know something about written communication and about literature.  A change is taking place in language and, as a result, in the literary work to which it owes its phenomenal existence (Barthes, “Work to Text”).  

parole to langage

information is a difference that makes a difference (Bateson)

Here is what I know: language is an organism that is always changing.  How we define and conceptualize “language” is a big question and open to debate.  In some sense “language” is always a metaphor for other things.  In another sense, it is just what it is: the means by which humans communicate with one another and experience, record, and describe the conditions of their existence.  As a natural attribute of humans, language is different from the technologies that humans create to manipulate, exploit, and use what simply is: language.  Writing, a term that encompasses a wide-range of technologies both as practices and as tools, exists in some relationship to natural languages, primarily perhaps to spoken language or speech, but also in relationship to other natural languages: seeing/sight, smelling/smell, touching/touch, hearing/sound

how writing does things, i.e., results in transactions, enables transactions, is changing.  It is being “automated,” which is to say that its functional property as logical code is being separated from its other functions, which were once part of all of those things:  processes, genres, conventions, that were part of what we call writing in a general sense.  

This quest to isolate and distinguish the “functional” aspect of written communication has a long history.  I am particularly interested in conceptions of this problem and in approaches to it in the 19th c.  In particular, Babbage’s mechanical notation (1826) and H.M. Bell’s Visible Speech. 



As Elizabeth Kirkpatrick writes in her definition of “Writing,” “Writing can be defined both by its material aspects as well as by its place in the media world and as a social practice. The Oxford English Dictionary defines writing as "wording or lettering scored, engraved, or impressed upon a surface; an inscription". (see type print) Indeed, the concrete materials used to write consist of both the markings themselves and the surface upon which the markings are made. However, the OED defines writing in several other ways as well, as "the occupation of a professional writer", and as "the action of composing and committing to manuscript... literary composition or production," giving a nod to the function of writing as a social practice and form of media in our society.” (Theory of Media Keywords)


It is my belief that Chomsky does not differentiate between spoken and written communication in the same way that Halliday does.

Couldn’t You Just Draw a Picture?  Time and Reading in Different Media

(you are inventing things in writing; you are making the objects (ideas) that you then use to communicate with)

Have we lost patience with words as a means to broadcast information?  

Writing is graphic communication.  We have lost patience with writing as a means of transmitting information.  We prefer to watch and listen to stories.  There are different ways to account for this socio-cultural shift.  Certainly, the advent of lower cost high-quality video recording, distribution, and viewing equipment is one reason.  However, another explanation relates to the separation of the discrete functions of verbal language and their re-packaging for ease of consumption.  Here is one, not terribly convincing example: the garden gnome.  As visual signifier, this is highly informative.  As verbal signifier, it is much less informative.  [note (December 8, 2017): the garden gnome was featured briefly in Robin’s short film “Out Again,” and it was the meanings attached to it in relation to the story being told in the film that prompted me to relate it as an example of (at the time) exactly the kind of commodification of information that I was talking about.  In retrospect, my notes on this topic are, at best, cursory.]  How processed do you like your humans?  Reading and writing are cultural practices and cultural constructs.  Spending time/making more time.  How do you spend your time?  In pennies or dollars?  You cannot save it, but you can allocate it.  You can also waste it.  Like water?  I’m not sure.  Probably more like those platters of cheese served on black plastic at every college meeting.  Those chunks of cheese are never all consumed.  There is a special section of the landfill reserved for those cubes of munster and cheddar and monterey jack.  Can you name what you are eating?  How can we consume more?  Distant reading.  Passing time.  Encoding.  The microchip as capitalism’s unconscious superego.  Alexa: 1125241.  Literacy as mapping.  Automation.  Yes, we can, but why would we?  Writing is a code.  REC=really existing capitalism.  Visible speech spells spelling: to say is to do.  In 1614 logos becomes a number.  What do we do when we spell a word?  We translate between two codes: writing and speaking.  

There are true, false, and open sentences in math.  There are also real and unreal numbers.  If a sentence is a complete thought, does that mean it is a complete sentence?  Where does this definition of a sentence come from?  





There is a story that I want us all to collaboratively research and write together about language and writing and government spending and media and coding and literature.  This is a story with many different threads and the story itself can only be told by bringing all of these threads together.  The thread of the story that I’ve been working on and that I’m going to talk about today begins in the 1860s with AMB’s visible speech and ends in the 1960s with ELIZA, who was a female character invented by a male writer and somehow (this is an important part of the story I want to tell) ends up as a set of instructions.  [There are many different ways of telling this joke, and I think each telling, i.e., manner in which it is told, may reveal something about the meaning of the material that constitutes the joke.]  It is a story about knowledge creation and knowledge transfer, the creation and reception of texts and technologies, and the roles of academia in the proliferation of professional and common knowledge.  It is a story at once factual in its bases but fictional in its shape since the 100 year time span that I am dealing with is much too large for any academic inquiry that hopes to prove anything definitively.  It will be as much about questions as arguments, which I believe may still be forming as we bring this series of interconnected materials together and look at them from different disciplinary perspectives.  What I am offering today is a rich set of data to be shared collectively and one possible narrative framing of that data.  How I make this shared data available to you is important and rather than dedicating this talk to a discussion of standards for sharing this data, which are ultimately much more important than my particular narrative interpretation of the data I have collected, I refer you to a document detailing those standards.  It is an open, in-process document that we must craft together moving forward.  

I have been interested in the roles and functions of standards in technical projects and technical communications for some time and curious to know if such methods might be adopted in the humanities.  This project can be seen as one experiment in technical humanist research.  Having not yet defined the terms for gauging the success of the project, I cannot say whether this project will or will not be successful.        



What if the cursor that you see on your computer screen originated from the human body?  Further, what if this symbol was originally derived from a mark signifying the emission of breath accompanying the formation of a spoken word?  While this may sound intriguing if somewhat implausible, I hope to convince you that the connections between the two apparently disparate realms of human and machine communication can be documented.  The story I plan to tell connects these two symbols, the spoken and the written, the human and the machine, the mechanical and the digital, in ways that may illuminate some pieces of the complex relationships that exist amongst old and new technologies of inscription and representation.

(Re)Mediating Alphabetic Language:
Alexander Melville Bell’s Visible Speech and the Conception and Use of Humans as Writing  Instruments in 19th c. Britain  
As one part of an ongoing, interdisciplinary and collaborative research project dedicated to investigating relationships and dynamics amongst conceptions of verbal language, information processing, and the history of computational and communications technologies, (Re)Mediating Alphabetic Language considers the importance of Alexander Melville Bell’s Visible Speech, a patented system of “universal shorthand,” to the development of 19th c. communications technologies, particularly Alexander Graham Bell’s telephone, as well as the longer term implications of this notational/writing system in conceptions of language and information processing at Bell Labs in the early 20th c.  The presentation engages with the work of Lisa Gitelman, Rita Raley, Michael Heim, and Matthew Kirschenbaum in its discussion of the changing value(s), definitions, and functions of written inscriptions in late 19th c. Britain and the U.S., and in its exploration of connections amongst alphabetic writing systems, technologies of literacy, and proto-machine languages. 



What is at issue is conceptions, models, and definitions of “the” human being written collectively by a global network of machines and human operators, many of whom, are unaware of their roles and functions in relation to machines.

Was Alexander Graham Bell Raised As a Telephone?  Technologies of Writing and Speaking in the 19th c. U.S. and Britain

Frankly beautiful, the curved, carving-like strokes of Alexander Melville Bell’s “universal language,” which he called Visible Speech, may remind most contemporary readers of what is at times even today, anachronistically, referred to as “Siamese,” one written script of the Tai-Kadai language family that most of North Americans will have seen at some point on a Thai takeout menu.  Though actually resembling Sinhalese characters in their appearance even more than Thai characters, the Visible Speech “alphabet” by default maintains some type of connection to these tonal languages by virtue of the fact that it is based on standardized graphic transcriptions of shorthand notations describing the discrete functions of the human speech organs.  Was Alexander Melville Bell familiar with south Asian language scripts in general or Sinhalese or “Siamese” scripts particularly?  As an elocutionist, a 19th c. term for one who studied verbal language production and use, it is quite likely, though the question of how Visible Speech is derived from Western imperial conceptions of these languages takes us down a different printed geneological path and with it a different bibliography.

  
The argument I am trying to make is that over the course of the last two centuries, the ways in which we define language have changed, moving from a natural/human definition to an artificial/machine definition.  The story of how this happens is extraordinarily complex and involves many different disciplines.  I don't want to oversimplify things and it is hard with such a broad argument not to do just that, but I am determined to put the pieces of this story together in some a manner that will help me make my point.  This is a story that has to do with how definitions of language are always in relation to  media and education and communications technologies. So here is how I envision telling this story at the moment: I want to begin the piece with a description of a film still from "My Fair Lady," which depicts a page from Henry Higgins' diary that is written in Visible Speech, a shorthand system developed by Alexander Melville Bell in the 1860s.  Higgins shows this page to Eliza Dolittle, who is unable to read it.  This is a fascinating moment for several different reasons.  First, the point of Visible Speech as it was developed was that it was supposed to be a "universal language," so the fact that Eliza cannot read it signifies that she is part of the "natural" world.  She will be taught to read this language and in the process to conform to the dialect standards of proper English.  However, to do so, she will have to learn to treat her body as a machine for the production of sounds.  Until then, she will not be able to understand the script, which is itself a set of instructions for the production of sounds and ultimately for the correct pronunciation of words.  What is happening in the mid-19th century is the "enclosing" of human language as a territory for development, exploitation, and capitalization.

Alexander Melville Bell was born at Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1819. He became interested in phonetics and defective speech because his father, Alexander Bell specialized in those areas. He was a lecturer on topics related to elocution at the University of Edinburgh (1843-1865) and at the University of London (1865-1870). When in Edinburgh, Melville invented a graphic representation of the speech sounds based on articulatory positions. He called his phonetic alphabet “Visible Speech” and used it as a method for teaching individuals with problems of articulation, stammering, and deafness to speak more clearly. Bell first developed his system in 1864 and published it in 1867 under the title: Visible speech: The science of universal alphabetics.
Melville Bell married Eliza Grace Symonds, a painter of miniatures and a pianist. Eliza Bell had a severe hearing loss, which strongly affected the interest that Melville had in designing methods for teaching the deaf and others with communication difficulties. Melville and Eliza had three sons, Edward (Ted), Alexander (Aleck) Graham (the inventor of the telephone), and Melville (Melly). Both Ted and Melly died of tuberculosis. Aleck also contracted the disease, so his parents decided to emigrate to Brantford Ontario, in 1870 to help him in his recuperation. Aleck was 23 at the time.
Late in the 1870s, while living in Brantford, Melville became affiliated with the department of philology at Queens College in Kingston. He worked there for three years. In 1881 Melville and his wife moved to Washington, D.C., where he continued working to teach the deaf to speak, using his visible speech approach and working with his son Aleck to promote the telephone.
Bell and his son Alexander Graham Bell authored a number of articles and books on Visible Speech, phonetics, and various aspects of elocution.
